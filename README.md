# odin-recipes
This is my first try of making a website. The goal of this mini-project was to get more familiar with, and solidify in my mind the HTML I have been learning through "The Odin Project."

Originally this project was just using HTML, but after continuing a bit further in my learning, I now had some CSS knowledge and wanted to practice a bit with that as well. At the beginning I didn't know much CSS, but I knew a decent amount about the foundations, so I was able to google whichever commands I needed to use for the features I wanted to add, such as the button hover, and add them accordingly.

This was a fun quick practice project, and it has definitely made me excited to learn more.
